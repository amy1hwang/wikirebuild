                <p class="indent">The <strong><a href="#">Earth-grazing meteoroid of 13 October 1990</a></strong> entered the <a href="#">atmosphere above Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="#">Poland</a> and, after 9.8 seconds, returned to space. Named EN131090, the 44-kilogram (97 lb) <a href="#">meteoroid</a> was observed travelling 409 kilometres (254 mi) at a speed of 42 km/s (26 mi/s) by cameras of the <a href="#">European Fireball Network</a>. Its <a href="#">apparent magnitude</a> peaked at âˆ’6.3, several times brighter than <a href="#">Venus</a>'s peak magnitude.
                <a href="#">Observations</a> of such events are quite rare; this was the second recorded by scientific astronomical instruments (after <a href="#">the 1972 Great Daylight Fireball</a>) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties, including its <a href="#">mass</a> and the structure of its upper layer. If the meteoroid had reached the lower atmosphere, it would have overheated and exploded high above the ground, leaving at most a few small <a href="#">meteorites</a> that posed no danger to the Earth's surface.
